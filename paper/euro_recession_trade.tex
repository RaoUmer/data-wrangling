    The Great Recession sparked a mini boom in research on trade collapses.  Several papers are relevant here.
\section{Trade Wedges} % (fold)
\label{sec:trade_wedges}
    Has the decline in trade been abnormally large?  To get a rough answer to this question, we can calculate what Levchnko \emph{et. al.} \cite{llt:2010} call a ``Trade Wedge''.  The ``wedge'' refers to the gap between the observed decline in trade and what would be predicted by a standard model.  The model specifies an import demand relationship as:
    \begin{equation}
        \hat{y}^f = \varepsilon(\hat{P} - \hat{p}^f) + (\hat{C + I})
    \end{equation}
    where carets indicate log changes, $y$ is the demand for imports, $P$ is the overall price level, $p^f$ is the price level of imports, and $(C + I)$ is consumption plus investment (aggregate demand).  Finally $\varepsilon$ is the elasticity of substitution.  If our simple model is entirely correct, this equation should hold exactly.  The difference between the calculated and predicted values is the trade wedge.  Since we're calculating log changes, $\hat{P}$ and $\hat{p}^f$ are log changes in the deflator for GDP and imports.

    \end{figure}

    As shown in \ref{fig:trade_wedge}, every country in this sample experienced a larger decline in trade than predicted by the model.  Of course, this may say more about our model that about whether the decline in trade was particularly large.  But, for a first-order approximation, it suggests that the decline in trade may be worth looking into further.
